This is a third-level directory or folder for the University of Idaho Experimental Forest drive; CLAN\I:\
I:\, Greater Moscow Mountain region topography feature folders may reside at this level.



Current folder contents:
ASPECT\			Data derived from a 10-meter DEM of the greater Moscow Mountain region.
CONTOUR\		Contour intervals derived from a 10-meter DEM of the greater Moscow Mountain region, 3-meter
			contour intervals from a graduate study program.
ELEVATION\		Digital Elevation Model (DEM) information, 10-meter resolution.
SLOPE\			Derived slope map from a 10-meter DEM of the greater Moscow Mountain region.

What Should Not Reside Here:
	Incomplete Projects---- workspace!
	Raw Project Data-------- workspace!
	Files or Folders that are finished projects------- distribute them into the appropriate folder structures (typically by subject)!
	Vegetation, geologic, inventory data-------------- distribute into the appropriate folder structure location(s).
	Culvert, cattleguard, gate inventories------------ distribute the files into the appropriate file structure locations(s).
	Climate data for another region (St. Maries, for example) without an application--------------- Keep the data with the application.
	Imagery that has an unknown projection, or projection other than UTM Zone 11, NAD 1983.-------- Re-project it!

If the current folder (directory) struture does not accomodate your contribution, contact the University of
Idaho Forest Manager or Assistant Manager to facilitate archiving your contribution.

Your co-operation is greatly appreciated and the key to successful data management.  
Don't let your hard work go to waste!
