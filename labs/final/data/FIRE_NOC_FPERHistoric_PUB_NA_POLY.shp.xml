        <title>Fire Perimeters Historic (Polygon)</title>
        <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>
        <othercit>Historic fire perimeters through year prior to each "current year".  Each year the "current year" is used to update this layer.  The current year is maintained as a separate feature.   For example, if the current year is 2016, fire perimeters for 2016 would be maintained in "Current Year", and historic would include perimeters through 2015.  In 2017, the 2016 current year would be migrated to "historic" and that layer would include perimeters through 2016.</othercit>

      <abstract>This polygon feature class represents the final spatial extent and boundaries of the BLM Fire Occurrence and History Perimeter: Final Perimeters. Current through 2017.</abstract>
      <purpose>BLM Fire Occurrence and History Perimeter: Final Perimeters are used for vegetation analysis such as habitat suitability, vegetation types and succession. Fire History can be used for current strategy and tactics on fires, fuels management, making forecasts for fire planning, analysis of vegetation and for stabilization and rehabilitation activities after fire. There are internal and external reporting requirements on burned acreage on a daily and annual basis. This will also provide timely updates for public web-services.</purpose>

        <procdesc>Source data through 2007 loaded into FGDB with common attribute schema .  Most source data  were in the format of shapefiles or coverages,   and maintained by BLM local Offices.  The "Current" perimeters for 2007 loaded into the polygon data.  Some data acquired from other agencies.

Attributes identifying reporting office (UNIT_ID, Field_Office) may reflect old district organizations for some fires. Cursory checks were made for dates out of range. Only a few records were found to be in error. Examples below Jarbidge "Dish Pan" 2001 F270 Date Start 8/30/2201 - Date Start Changed to 8/30/2001.  Shoshone "McKay" 1975 Date Start 7/15/2075 - Date Start Changed to 7/15/1975 - Shoshone "Kimama 1" 1971 Date Start 7/2/2071 - Date Start changed to 7/2/1971 

At some point perimeters were segregated into "Current Year"  and "Historic" to facilitate multiuser editing in SDE over our very slow network., as well as providing "new" fires to national ftp sites.   When the perimeters were segregated into "Current" and "Historic", the CREAT_BY , CREATE_DATE, MODIFY_BY, and MODIFY_DATE fields were not retained in the Historic data set.  Records prior to 2016 will have default values for those fields.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Fires updated through 2012.. The update included 2011 perimeters collected by the BLM, as well as perimeters provided by Idaho National Laboratory. The INL update also included an updated fire perimeter for 2010, Middle Butte Fire. The original perimeter was GPS'd based on firelines used for a backburn. The updated perimeter was derived from imagery and reflected what actually burned., and was approximately 1/2 the size of the original perimeter. The fire/fuels resource specialist at the Upper Snake Field Office requested that updated perimeter be used since it better reflected the conditions.  Looks like some process steps missed between 2010-2012, oh well.

        <procdesc>Historic Fire perimeters (through 2015) were copied from corporate SDE to a work area.  New attributes not previously captured in the perimeters were added and calculated.  Existing attributes were migrated into the new standard.  Several attributes that were not part of the standard were retained at the request of the District.   No intentional changes were made to the geometry.   Perimeters may include perimeters from adjacent states as well as perimeters that do not have a record in BLM's official fire occurrence database, Wildland Fire Management System (WFMI).  WFMI records are available from 1980 to present.  These Historic fire perimeters include many perimeters prior to 1980.  The process for migrating existing attributes and populating were migrated or created described below.  Attribute definitions and descriptions can be found in the Attribute/Field section.

 The FPER_V2 standard allows for, but does not mandate mapping "Unburned Islands" greater than 10 acres within a perimeters.  If Unburned Islands are mapped, the standard requires mapping them as "donut holes".  Many of the historic perimeters prior to 2006 reflect their heritage as ArcInfo "coverages", and Unburned areas are mapped as polygons within the perimeters and attributed as "Unburned Islands".

The Fire Codes in the perimeters were reviewed to identify fire codes in the perimeters that did not occur in WFMI.   A subquery was used for this. The firecode is a unique 4-character alpha-numeric code assigned to a specific incident. See WFMI BLM User Guide 2016.  In reviewing WFMI codes, it was  revealed that the codes are not necessarily uinique.   Many of the fire codes not found in WFMI were typos as well as other errors.  Some errors were valid codes, but for a different fire.  Records may include records that would not be captured in WFMI, such as fires outside of BLM managed lands or response areas or that BLM did not provided assistance/support to.  Local Offices may want to review perimeters occurring after 1980 that do not seem to occur in WFMI and work with Dispatch Offices to determine if the record should be in WFMI.  Some firecodes matched the firecode in the FIRECODE system, but did not match WFMI.  Those records were edited to match WFMI so that they could be joined to WFMI.  Firecodes are not unique.   Unique IDs (or almost unique) were assigned to both the WFMI data and Perimeters by concatenating the Year, Reporting Unit, and Fire Code Fields.  Summaries on the “Unique-ID” were made so that records could be filtered for unique-ids occurring more than once, prior to joining the WFMI data to the Fire Perimeters.  Tables were joined to the WFMI data so that attributes could be calculated from the WFMI.  The Reporting Unit as reported in WFMI had not been previously included in the perimeters, and was added prior to creating the "unique id". 

POO_JRSDCTNL_UNIT_ID.   Firetype/ProtectionType and Ownership codes in the WFMI data as well as GIS layers for BLM Surface Management Agency (SMA), Federal-State Interagency Fire Protection Boundary, and BLM, USFS  National Park Service (NPS) administrative boundaries were used to assign  POO_JRSDCTNL_UNIT_ID .   POO_JRSDCTNL_UNIT_ID  Codes are from the National Wildfire Coordinating Group Unit Identifier.  NWCG, (http://www.nwcg.gov).  Codes for all jurisdictional areas were not available, such as Idaho Department of Fish and Game, Military/COE areas in Eastern Idaho.  Those areas may be unattributed.  For some areas, it is unclear, such the Fort Hall Indian Reservation in Eastern Idaho ,  the Orchard Training Range in Southwestern Idaho, and Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) Lands throughout southwestern Idaho.  Some of the "BOR" lands identified by BLM Idaho Surface Management (SMA) layer might not be managed by the BOR, but might have some other status.   Discrepancies within WFMI coding for firetype/protectiontype/ownership codes as well as discrepancies in WFMI and GIS layers were observed, but no attempt was made to resolve the discrepancies.   This attribute had not previously been part of the fire perimeters.   

POO_PRTCT_UNIT_ID.  Firetype/ProtectionType and Ownership codes in the WFMI data as well as GIS layers for SMA, Federal-State Interagency Fire Protection Boundary,  and  BLM and USFS administrative boundaries were used to select codes from the National Wildfire Coordinating Group  Unit Identifier. NWCG, (http://www.nwcg.gov).   This attribute had not previously been part of the fire perimeters. Discrepancies within WFMI coding for firetype/protectiontype/ownership codes as well as discrepancies in WFMI and GIS layers were observed, but no attempt was made to resolve the discrepancies.  If the point of origin is outside of Federal or State jurisdiction, the local protection entity might not be known, and there might not be a local protection entity for the time the fire occurred.   Local Fire Protection changes over time and may or may not include wildland fire protection, and it may or may not include all areas within its boundary.  Many of these areas are responded to by the BLM, but the BLM might not be  the entity responsible for providing direct incident management and services to the given area pursuant to its jurisdictional responsibility or as specified by law, contract, or agreement.  

RPT_UNIT_ID.  This attribute was not previously captured in Idaho perimeters and was added during the migration to the new standard.  It was guestimated based on the fire location, year and WFMI location  For some areas, there is some correlation with Field Office or District Boundary, but for some areas such as "Southern Idaho District (1997-2001), a boundary could not be found.  The Reporting Unit for Idaho does change in extent and with time, as described in the attribute/field section.  The BLM Administrative District and Field Office in Idaho also changes with time,   The "Craters of the Moon NM (IDCMD) did not seem to be used by WFMI, and is not used here.   For a description of the BLM RPT_UNIT_ID refer to the BLM User Guides for WFMI.

LOCAL_INCDNT_ID.  Calculated from the FIRECODE data provided by the NOC.  Those records are available from 2004 to present.    A few records in that data were incomplete, and the LOCAL_INCDNT_ID could not be calculated.   

FIRE_CODE_ID.  Most records 1980-2015 were calculated from the "FIRE_NUM' in the original data, maintained as HISTORIC_IDAHO_FIRE_NUMBER in this dataset.  Records 1980-2015 were compared to WFMI, and if a match was not found, an attempt was made to correct the fire code attribute.  A subquery was used to select “firecodes” in the perimeters that did not occur in WFMI.  Not all records in WFMI have XY’s or the XY falls outside of the perimeter, which complicates verifying perimeters with WFMI.  Some perimeters did not seem to have a record in WFMI.   Many of the fires that could not be matched were in the Orchard Training Range or land managed by the Idaho National Laboratory.   A few fires on BLM managed were in areas protected by the Idaho Department of Lands (IDL) or the US Forest Service (USFS), and might not have been entered in WFMI or were coded differently than the perimeter.  Some perimeters may be outside of BLM's reporting system, but were included by Districts for various analysis needs.  WFMI and FIRECODE point locations, and other information in the perimeters attributes were used to try and determine the fire code when codes were in error or could not be found in WFMI.     An effort was made to correct errors in the original fire code for the perimeter.  Those errors can be found by using a subquery with the HISTORIC_IDAHO_FIRE_NUMBER and WFMI.    The FIRE_CODE_ID for records prior to 1980 were calculated to equal zero.  A subquery was used on the original fire code for the polygon (Historic_Idaho_Fire_Number).  The WFMI data pulled included all reports except for severity and false alarms.
 This subquery was used:
RPTUNIT_YEAR_FCODE Not IN (SELECT RPTUNIT_YEAR_FCODE  FROM WFMI_import_From_Excel_Defaults)  AND FIRE_DSCVR_CY &gt;= 1980

INCDNT_NM.  Calculated from original perimeter “FIRE_NAME”.  No edits were made.  A few records had different names than WFMI (other than how it was abbreviated), but the names were not edited to match WFMI. A few records were calculated from WFMI if the original data did not record the name of the fire.  

FIRE_DSCVR_CY.  Calculated from original Perimeter "Fire_Year”.  One or two records were edited where the original "Start_Date" and "Fire_Year" had a different Year, and the Start_Date matched WFMI.  
FIRE_DSCVR_DT.   Calculated from the original Perimeter “Date_Start".  If the original Date_Start was coded 12/31/xxxx or 1/1/xxxx (where xxxx = year) indicating the exact date was unknown, and the Start_Date was available in WFMI, then the FIRE_DSCVR_DT was calculated to match WFMI.  If the “Date_Start" was complete, but different than WFMI, then it was not recalculated.

FIRE_DSCVR_DT_EST_FLAG.  Compared to WFMI "StartTiime". to the FIRE_DSCVR_DT of the perimeter,  Perimeters with the same date calculated "NO", else calculated "YES".  Many perimeters had FIRE_DSCVR_DT that were 1-3 days different than recorded in WFMI "StartTiime”.

FIRE_CNTRL_DT.    This attribute was not captured in Idaho perimeters and was added during the migration to the new standard.  Perimeters joined to WFMI data and calculated equal the ControlDate.

FIRE_CNTRL_DT_EST_FLAG.  Records with known control dates calculated "NO", else "YES"

FIRE_CAUSE_NM.  Calculated from the original perimeter, "Cause"

FPER_DOM_CLCTN_MTHD.   Calculated from the original perimeter "Mapping_Source".  Almost all records matched the new schema.  A few were calculated to the best fit.

TOTAL_RPT_ACRES_NR.  Calculated to equal the Reported Acres in WFMI.  The  acres reported in TOTAL_RPT_ACRES_NR and the acres calculated in the "GIS_Acres"  can vary widely. "Unburned Islands" were calculated equal 0.   A few records had multiple polygons for the fire; all polygons for the fire were calculated to the reported acres in WFMI
GIS_ACRES.  Calculated to equal the original perimeter GIS_ACRES.  No changes were made.

CMPLX_NM.  Calculated = original perimeter "Complex_NA"

IRWIN_ID.  Not calculated

COMMENT.  Calculated to equal the original perimeter "Comments".  

ADM_UNIT_CD - Calculated to equal original perimeter "ADM_UNIT_CD".  No changes made. Idaho perimeters could be Field Office Name or District Office Name, both are used in this data.  What is intended?

ADMIN_ST.  -  Calculated to equal the administrative state as reported in WFMI.

PERCENT_BU - From original perimeters.  Not part of FPER_V2 standard

GPS_UNIT_T  - From original perimeters.  Not part of FPER_V2 standard

DATAFILE - From original perimeters.  Not part of FPER_V2 standard

GPS_DATE    - From original perimeters.  Not part of FPER_V2 standard

HISTORIC_IDAHO_FIRE_NUMBER .  Original "FIRE_NUM" (firecode).  No edits made to original data

        <attrlabl>POO_PRTCT_UNIT_ID</attrlabl>
        <attrdef>The active National Wildfire Coordinating Group ( NWCG ) Unit Identifier of the entity responsible for providing direct incident management and services to the given area pursuant to its jurisdictional responsibility or as specified by law, contract, or agreement.  The assigned code is based on the Point of Origin of the Fire, and might not reflect how the fire was managed as it grew.  The Point of Origin Protecting Unit Identifier might not reflect who actually responded to or managed the fire.  If the origin of the fire was on private land and local fire protection entities were unknown and/or protection agreements were unknown, the area might be unattributed.  If a WFMI point was not available to identify the point of Origin, the area may be unattributed.  NWCG Codes did not seem to be available for all areas.   A complete list of NWCG codes can be found   https://wfmi.nifc.gov/unit_id/Publish.html.    

In Southern Idaho, BLM has protection agreements for State Lands and private timber lands, as well as BOR, COE, and Military Lands.   BLM also seems to protect NWR, NPS.  There may or may not be a protection agreement for this.    The USFS and Idaho Department of Lands (IDL) protect BLM managed land in northern Idaho.  BLM managed land within the Payette NF administrative boundary is protected by the Payette NF.  The Firetype/Protection Type and ownership codes in WFMI as well as GIS layers SMA, Idaho Federal-State Interagency Fire Protection boundaries, and BLM/USFS administrative boundaries were used to determine which NWCG code to use.  

Jurisdiction and fire protection change with time.  A combination of the Firetype/Protectiontype and ownership codes in WFMI and GIS layers for BLM  2016 Idaho Surface Management (SMA), 2016  Interagency Fire Protection Agreement (sometimes called "offset agreement"), and BLM , USFS,  administrative boundaries ,  were used to guestimate the POO_JRSDCTNL_UNIT_ID.  This can be a problem since the SMA reflects 2016, and the codes in WFMI may reflect a different time.  There have also been some changes overtime in fire protection agreements.  The 2016 Interagency Fire Protection Agreement is an agreement between the US Forest Service, BLM, and the State (Idaho).  Other lands such as BOR and Military are not part of this agreement and are covered by other agreements.   It is unlikely that anyone will ever use this attribute for anything meaningful, so maybe all the nuances and problems are moot.

The Firetype/ProtectionType and Ownership codes in WIFMI did not always match one another.   For example, some WFMI records coded as Firetype/protectiontypes coded 11, 12, 13, or 21, (BLM land protected by somebody), had ownerships codes other than "1" (BLM).   Some   WFMI records coded as Firetype/protectiontypes 15 or 16 (Non-BLM protected by BLM), were coded as "1" (BLM).  The Firetype/protectiontypes and ownership codes in WFMI are not always as precise as the codes available in NWCG.  For example, WFMI may code an area as National Park Service (NPS), where NWCG has the specific NPS Unit such as Craters of the Moon National Monument (USIDCMP) or Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument (USIDHFP).  WFMI does not identify the specific agency that has protection responsibility for BLM managed lands when the entity is other than BLM.   Records may be coded as 15, 16, 25, or 26, indicating that it is BLM managed lands protected by different entity.  NWCG has specific codes for the Idaho Department of Lands (IDL) or USFS, such as USIDMCS, IDL, Maggie Creek Area Office or USIDPAF, USFS, Payette National Forest.   "Assist Fires" coded as 37 in WFMI are even more confusing,

        <attrdef>The active National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) Unit Identifier of the governmental entity reported to the authoritative fire reporting system.
  The Reporting Unit ID here is the Reporting Unit ID in the Wildland Fire Information System (WFMI).   WFMI Reporting Units prefixed with "US" as required by the 2016 FPER standard.     Most of the values listed in WFMI for Idaho do not occur in the NWCG downloaded 4/2016. The values here represent the values as reported in WFMI.  These Reporting Units could change as BLM standardizes fire reporting.  Fires prior to 1980 are coded as "USNA" The Fires coded in WFMI often correspond to Idaho BLM Field Offices (as of 2005), but not always.  As much as possible, the WFMI codes were used, regardless of the fire's location.  BLM Reporting Units in Idaho change in time and extent.  So fires in the same area may be coded differently depending on the year of the fire.

It is derived from a CAD system for BLM and is used in multiple systems for tracking in programs such as FireCode, ROSS, WFDSS, IQCS, and SIT209.  In this dataset it was calculated from the numeric portion of the Incident Identifier in FIRECODE.   FIRECODE was implemented in 2004, so  the LOCAL_INCDNT_ID was not available prior to 2004 from FIRECODE.  A FIRECODE dataset was provided by the BLM National Operations Center (NOC).  If the FIRECODE Incident ID  was not available or was incomplete, the Local_INCDNT_ID was calculated to equal "0" .  Null values are not allowed by the Standard.

        <attrlabl>FIRE_CODE_ID</attrlabl>
        <attrdef>The BLM Cost accounting tracking number.  From WFMI :  Fire Code: The unique 4-character alpha-numeric code assigned to a specific incident. Since Fiscal Year 2004, each BLM individual fire report requires a unique Fire Code obtained from the FireCode System at https://www.firecode.gov for all fire types/protection types. The same Fire Code cannot be assigned to multiple fires. (Exception: the United States Forest Service (USFS) assigns one FireCode per forest for ABCD Misc. fires to be used for initial attack, false alarms and extended attack if under 300 acres. So, for USFS ABCD Misc. fires, BLM will use the single assigned code and not generate a separate FireCode for each USFS ABCD fire.)

In this dataset, the  FIRE_CODE_ID is the Fire Code as reported to WFMI.  This is a four character code and is usually used as an identifier for a fire, but it is not unique, and may need to be combined with other information such as FIRE_DSCVR_CY (Calendar Year)  and/or , State,  and/or Reporting Unit ID to query a particular fire.  Many of the original Fire Codes in the perimeters did not match fire codes in WFMI, and some perimeters occurring 1980-present  do not seem to have a record in WFMI.  Some of the firecodes in WFMI occurring after 2004 do not match the firecode in FIRECODE.  Perimeters that often did not seem to have a record in WFMI include fires in the Orchard Training Range and lands managed by the Idaho National Laboratory.   Some of the fires on BLM managed land that were in areas protected by the US Forest Service or Idaho Department of Lands did not seem to have a record in WFMI.   An effort was made to determine how fires were coded in WFMI, and when the perimeter code did not have a match in WFMI, it was recoded to the value in WFMI.    For some records, the firecode in WFMI did not match the firecode in the FIRECODE system.   For those records, the WFMI firecode was used.   The original polygon firecode is retained in the  HISTORIC_IDAHO_FIRE_NUMBER field.  The location of the record in WFMI was often used to help verify polygon attributes with WFMI.  This was often unclear if a fire in WFMI was coded as an "Assist Fire", because many of those do not include the XY information.

Original values were not changed and may have been calculated in UTM 11 or UTM 12 or Idaho Transverse Mercator.  They may or may not have been updated if any edits were made to the perimeter.   Some records have GIS_Acres &lt; 1 which might reflect polygons created by overlapping perimeters rather than an individual fire.  GIS Acres were not recalculated to the FPER_V2  standard and were copied from the original data.
The standard requires that GIS_ACRES  are calculated in USA_Contiguous_Albers_Equal_Area_Conic

        <attrdef>The active NWCG Unit Identifier of the governmental entity having overall land and resource management for the specific geographical area as provided by law for the piece of land where the fire started.  

POO_JRSDCTNL_UNIT_ID  is based on the Point of Origin of the Fire, and might not reflect land jurisdiction in all areas of the fire or even the majority of the fire.   Not all areas are coded.   NWCG codes are not available for all of Idaho.   If a WFMI  point was not available to identify the point of Origin or jurisdiction was uncertain, the area may be uncoded.   The older the fire, the less likely the WFMI  location is accurate.  
 NWCG Codes did not seem to be available for all areas, such as  Idaho Department of Fish and Game, and Military/COE areas in Eastern Idaho.  Areas in the Saylor Creek Military area might be coded as  USIDMHQ (Mountain Home Air Force Base), this may or may not be the correct code for this area.  There is  BOR  area in Eastern Idaho managed by the BOR Upper Colorado Regional Office (USCOBRL).  All other BOR areas in Idaho are managed by the BOR Pacific Northwest Region (USIDBRL).   In this data set, some areas coded as Idaho Private Lands (USIDPRI) might be areas managed by cities or counties.  

Jurisdiction changes with time.  A combination of the Firetype/Protectiontype and ownership codes in WFMI and GIS layers for BLM  2016 Idaho Surface Management (SMA), 2016  InterAgency Fire Protection Agreement (sometimes called "offset agreement"), and BLM  and  USFS administrative boundaries ,  were used to guestimate the POO_JRSDCTNL_UNIT_ID.  This can be a problem since the SMA reflects 2016, and the codes in WFMI may reflect a different time.  There has also been some changes overtime in fire protection agreements.  2016  InterAgency Fire Protection Agreement is between the US Forest Service, BLM , and the State.  Other lands such as BOR and Military are not part of this agreement and are covered by other agreements. 

The Firetype/ProtectionType and Ownership codes  in WIFMI did not always match one another.   For example,  some WFMI records coded as Firetype/protectiontypes coded 11, 12, 13, or 21, (BLM land protected by somebody), had ownerships codes other than "1" ( BLM).   Some   WFMI records coded as Firetype/protectiontypes 15 or 16 ( Non-BLM protected by BLM), were coded as "1" (BLM).  The  Firetype/protectiontypes and ownership codes in WFMI  are not always as precise as the codes available in NWCG.  For example, WFMI may code an area as National Park Service (NPS), where NWCG has the specific NPS Unit such as Craters of the Moon National Monument (USIDCMP) or Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument (USIDHFP).

        <attrdef>A unique ( or almost unique) identifier for the fire.  Created by concatenating FIRE_DSCVR_CY,  RPT_UNIT_ID, and FIRE_CODE_ID fields.  This attribute is not part of the 2016 FPER_V2 standard or original perimneter schema.  It was created for purposes of uniquely identifying records in WFMI  so that they could be used to attribute and verify attributes in the perimeters.
 The Firecodes in WFMI  are not unique.  This field was created in both the perimeters and in the WFMI data so that information that did not exist in the perimeters could be extracted from WFMI (such as FIRE_CNTRL_DT, TOTAL_RPT_ACRES_NR) , as well as comparing existing fields such as the FIRE_DSCVR_DT to the date reported to WFMI.  If records were incomplete for  existing fields and available in WFMI, that information was extracted.  Not all records could be joined to WFMI.    The Firetype/Protectiontype and ownership codes in WFMI were used to help with coding the POO_JRSDCTNL_UNIT_ID and  POO_PRTCT_UNIT_ID fields, but were not retained in this dataset.  The  RPTUNIT_Year_FCODE in not unique, but it was not a problem.   Most of the repeating codes occurred in perimeters with multiple polygons for the fire, Unburned Islands within a perimeter, or in the Orchard Training Range.

    <overview>
      <eaover>The schema includes many of the attributes found in  WFMI, BLM's official record system for fire occurrence, as well as additional attributes not found in WFMI, and attributes that are not part of the FPER standard that Districts wanted to retain.  The attributes that are not part of the Standard are optional and may or may not be used for fires occurring after 2015.
Attributes provide the date the fire started as well as the date the fire was declared controlled, fire name, fire code, fire cause,  perimeter collection method, and many other attributes. Some attributes may be incomplete. The comment fields are free text, and most are null, but are sometimes used to identify unburned islands within a given fire.  If  existing perimeters did not capture attributes found in WIFMI or were incomplete, then WFMI was used. If the  FIRE_DSCVR_DT  was complete but did not was not match WFMI's StartTime, the original FIRE_DSCVR_DT was not changed to match WFMI.  The FIRE_DSCVR_EST_FLAG  was used to indicate that it did not match the StartTime in WFMI.  The FIRE_CNTRL_DT and TOTAL_RPT_ACRES_NR fields were not previously captured and were copied from WFMI.  The LOCAL_INCDNT_ID was not previously captured and was calculated from FIRECODE.    The RPT_UNIT_ID was not previously captured in the perimeters and was guestimated as described in the lineage and field sections of this metadata.

FIRE_CODE_ID.  In this dataset, it is the FireCode as reported to WFMI.  This is a four character code and is usually used as an identifier for a fire, but it is not unique, and may need to be combined with other information such as FIRE_DSCVR_CY (Calendar Year)  and/or , State,  and/or Reporting Unit ID to query a particular fire.  Many of the original Fire Codes in the perimeters did not match fire codes in WFMI, and some perimeters occurring 1980-present  do not seem to have a record in WFMI.  See discussion in the fields section for more details. 

RPT_UNIT_ID.  Reporting Units were not in the original attributes and were assigned manually (best guestimate).  GIS layers for the  fire perimeters, WFMI locations, BLM admin boundaries were used.  One issue is that in Idaho, the Reporting Unit ID changes with time and may change by extent.  The Reporting Unit in WFMI might even reflect who actually responded to/managed the fire  rather than the official reporting unit.  See details in the fields section.  Unique IDs were created in both the perimeters and  WFMI data by concatenating the Year, Reporting Unit, and Firecode.  Then tables were joined.  Tables physically joined, virtual join in ArcMap failed miserably.  Firetype/Protectiontype and ownership codes in WFMI and GIS layers used to assign/calculate POO codes.  Total Reported Acres and Control dates calculated from WFMI fields.

The  POO_JRSDCTNL_UNIT_ID  and  POO_PRTCT_UNIT_ID   represent the active National Wildfire Coordinating Group ( NWCG ) Unit Identifier of the entity responsible for providing direct incident management and services to the given area pursuant to its jurisdictional responsibility or as specified by law, contract, or agreement and the active NWCG Unit Identifier of the governmental entity having overall land and resource management for the specific geographical area as provided by law for origin of  the fire.   They may or may not reflect who responded to or managed the fire or the overall management of the land within the perimeter.  "Local" protection by city/volunteer/ rural/subscription services is not reflected . For fire origins outside of federal or State jurisdiction/management, no effort was made to determine if there was  Non-Federal or Non-State entity with fire protection or incident management responsibilities.  "Jurisdiction" and "Protection" may change with time.  These attributes could be misleading depending on how they are used.  So don't. 

At some point  (2008 ? ) perimeters were segregated into "Current Year" and "Historic" to facilitate multiuser editing in SDE over our very slow network., as well as providing "new" fires to national ftp sites.   When the perimeters were segregated into "Current" and "Historic", the CREAT_BY , CREATE_DATE, MODIFY_BY, and MODIFY_DATE fields were not retained in the Historic data set.  Records prior to 2016 will have default values for those fields.
