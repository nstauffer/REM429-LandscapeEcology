# Hierarchical Scale of an Ecosystem Process
## Assignment Description:
In this lab you will develop a hierarchical scale of an important ecosystem process. Select a process for which you have some familiarity, not to include biomass growth or disturbance since these will be used as class examples. Working as part of a team of 2-3 people, fill out the table below. Add as many levels as you believe necessary to describe the process selected. Be prepared to discuss your results with the class during the last half of the lab.
